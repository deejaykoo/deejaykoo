Hi, Iâ€™m @deejaykoo, you can call me deejay, koo or deejaykoo, whatever you're comfortable with.

I made this github page to share my Korean translation txt files of a game called Guild Wars 2 to the public. 
I am hoping my work will hlep other Koreans to be able to play Guild Wars 2 with a bit more immersion and without struggling to understand the stories of the game. 
While I cannot upload the program that is required to translate the texts, I can upload the txt files from which the program can recognize and display the translated texts in real time.

The translation does take time since the there are different stories depending on race and choices you make, which makes the volume of the stories a lot larger than people think. 
Also, since English is not my native tongue, I cannot understand some of the expressions they use. 
So, there may be some errors or flaws within translation. But I am hoping it will get better as the time goes by.

Anyways, I hope you find my translation useful (probably to Koreans), and hopefully I can finish this translation project as soon as possible.

Thanks
